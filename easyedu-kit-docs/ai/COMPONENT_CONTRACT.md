# EasyEdu Component Contract

This document defines reusable component contracts that agents must preserve
when moving UI from one plugin to another.

## Inverse visual audit

When a consuming plugin has a more complete visual result than the kit, audit
the rendered plugin and promote the reusable finish into the canonical kit
before copying it to another plugin.

Must:

- compare computed backgrounds, borders, radii, spacing and states;
- preserve plugin-owned ids, `data-*`, DOM order and interaction classes;
- use `context-modal-surface` plus a semantic variant for shared modal chrome;
- use `semantic-accent-panel` for reusable coloured rails;
- use `semantic-table-surface` or `sticky-data-table` without changing columns
  or overflow ownership;
- validate the source plugin still renders equivalently after extraction.

Must not:

- approximate an EasyStud gradient or rail with a new local value;
- move crop, resize, drag/drop or sticky-preview behaviour into visual mixins;
- hide action menus by applying unreviewed clipping to their parent surface.

For guide visual parity, also use `ai/GUIDE_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md`. That checklist
is mandatory when a guide implementation is compared with EasyStud, Course
Banner Builder or another plugin using the same guide kit.

## Administration typography

Must:

- inherit the active Moodle theme font through `--easyedu-font-family-ui`;
- use the shared typography roles for page, modal, panel, section, card,
  control, body, caption and eyebrow text;
- use only the shared regular, medium, semibold and strong weights for reusable
  administration chrome;
- preserve plugin-owned wrapping, truncation and responsive layout rules.

Must not:

- introduce plugin-local title scales when a shared role exists;
- use negative or decorative letter spacing;
- apply administration roles to user-configurable banner, slideshow or authored
  preview content.

## Balanced administration navigation

Must:

- keep the guide wrapper as the first direct child of the navigation rail;
- use `.easyedu-admin-primary-nav--balanced` when menu actions must be centred
  independently of the guide;
- wrap those actions in `.easyedu-admin-primary-nav__actions`;
- retain a start-aligned horizontal scroller on narrow screens.

Must not:

- centre the guide with the menu actions;
- add empty balancing markup or plugin-local left/right offsets;
- allow translated action labels to wrap onto a second line.

## Segmented single choice

Must:

- use a native `fieldset`, `legend` and radios sharing one `name`;
- use the contained structure with an accessible `__legend`, visible internal
  `__label` and bordered `__body`;
- keep each radio immediately before its visual surface;
- allow the legend and option descriptions to wrap without clipping;
- use the regular density for explanatory strategies and `compact` only in
  dense settings/filter surfaces;
- preserve checked, hover, focus-visible and disabled semantics.

Must not:

- replace radios with non-semantic clickable cards;
- expose the native legend visually over the component border or force
  translated titles to one line;
- use this component for multi-select or binary on/off controls.

## Slideshow administration surfaces

Must:

- combine `slideshow-admin-grid`, `slideshow-card-layout` and
  `slideshow-card-body-layout` when Course/Site or equivalent context cards
  must share one height;
- use `slideshow-settings-grid` so each Content/Controls section stops at its
  real content height;
- use `slideshow-action-zone` to align editor and reset actions without fixed
  card heights;
- preserve checked, unchecked, focus and disabled semantics through
  `slideshow-toggle-row`;
- pass one stable semantic accent through the complete card;
- preserve plugin-owned input names, values, ids, modal targets and event
  handlers.

Must not:

- stretch tinted settings sections only to align sibling card footers;
- use fixed content heights to equalise context cards;
- reference private or undefined visual tokens when a public `--easyedu-*`
  token exists;
- move activation, persistence or preview behaviour into the visual mixins.

## Preview-side disclosures

Must:

- exclude accordion disclosure triggers from generic preview command-button
  selectors;
- let `preview-side-accordion-trigger` own every visual trigger state;
- let `preview-side-accordion-panel` own the connected panel surface;
- keep only plugin-specific geometry or motion orchestration in the consumer;
- verify collapsed, expanded and collapsed-again states in the rendered modal.

Must not:

- restyle all `[aria-expanded="true"]` preview buttons as commands;
- duplicate the accordion mixin later in a plugin stylesheet to repair the
  cascade;
- change disclosure ids, `data-*` hooks or motion ownership while cleaning
  visual overrides.

## Guide: show in interface selector

Canonical files:

- `guide/amd/src/easyedu_guide.js`
- `guide/templates/easyedu_guide.mustache`
- `scss/easyedu/components/_guide.scss`
- `docs/components/guide.md`

Must:

- resolve targets by configured target key or CSS selector;
- close the guide modal while preserving the highlight;
- scroll the target into view;
- use a `position: fixed` viewport-anchored highlight;
- keep the highlight aligned during scroll and resize;
- refresh after Bootstrap modal open/close, CSS transitions, animations, DOM
  mutations and `easyedu:guide-refresh-highlight`;
- dock guided checklists away from the highlighted target;
- show the sticky return-to-guide panel;
- clear the highlight when the return panel is dismissed;
- clear the highlight automatically when the temporary return panel auto-hides;
- allow return to the guide without losing context;
- add the stable `is-easyedu-guide-highlight-target` class to the highlighted
  target while active.

Must not:

- implement plugin-local absolute-position selectors;
- let the outline drift during scroll;
- depend on one static measurement after the click;
- use native `title` tooltips for guide actions;
- replace the kit selector with a local style that only approximates it.

Show-in-interface highlights are temporary. Guided checklist highlights are
temporary too, but only the highlight disappears: the checklist panel remains
visible so the user can continue the guided path without the selector staying on
screen indefinitely.

The highlight controller must keep one active target, one auto-hide timer and
one requestAnimationFrame refresh loop. It must not use competing hard timers,
persistent suppressed states, or an unbounded document-wide MutationObserver.
Use the shared `highlightStyle` option for visual variants such as
`pulse-blue`; never fork the lifecycle code just to change the look.

## Guide: action target versus visual target

Some guided checklist steps must wait for a real action target while visually
highlighting a more helpful parent area. For example, a "select source" step may
complete when the submit button is clicked, but the user should see the source
dropdown wrapper rather than an empty configured-source table.

Must:

- support `highlightTarget` on checklist steps;
- support `targetselector` on slide-level show-in-interface buttons when the
  concrete selector is known server-side;
- resolve `highlightTarget` by configured target key or CSS selector;
- keep `target` as the real action/completion target;
- highlight `highlightTarget` when it is provided, otherwise fall back to
  `showTarget`, then `target`;
- highlight the first available checklist step immediately when a guided path
  starts;
- keep the highlight layer above Moodle modal content and below the guided
  checklist;
- target stable controls such as dropdown wrappers, creation rows or buttons
  instead of empty result tables.

Must not:

- point onboarding steps to empty tables when the course/plugin has no data yet;
- point source-selection steps to Moodle navigation just because the label is
  similar;
- duplicate both old and new selectors for the same step.

## Guide: locked slides and unlock paths

Must:

- allow slides to declare `requires`;
- add `is-locked` to unavailable navigation cards;
- keep locked navigation cards clickable so the user can read why they are
  locked;
- skip locked slides in next/previous and keyboard navigation;
- use short one-word badges such as `Locked`;
- display long explanations in `.easyedu-guide-slide__locked`;
- support `requirestitle`, `requirescontent`, `unlockpath` and `unlocklabel`;
- render unlock paths with the alternate unlock checklist style;
- keep unlock paths separate from normal practice paths.

Must not:

- use long requirement text inside navigation badges;
- use a pointer cursor on locked navigation cards because they remain clickable
  to explain how to unlock the slide;
- share the same path name for a normal guided path and an unlock path.

## Guide: learning visuals and guided-path slides

Must:

- use kit-owned visual blocks for reusable guide illustrations;
- use the kit scene catalogue for learning slides: `visualcards`,
  `visualcarddetail`, `visualassignment`, `visualfiltersdemo`,
  `visualpaste`, `visualcontextmenu`, `visualactionflow`,
  `visualdragdrop`, `visualformula`, `visualsteps` and `visualkeys`;
- use `.easyedu-guide-guided-card` for slides that launch a guided path;
- keep the guided path explanation, step preview and start button in the same
  card so the action does not feel detached from the slide content;
- add any new cross-plugin animation or visual pattern to the kit before using
  it in a plugin.
- provide responsive and reduced-motion states for every animated scene.

Must not:

- copy EasyStud-only visual class names into another plugin;
- create local guide animation keyframes when a kit animation exists;
- leave guided-path slides as plain text plus an isolated button.

## Runtime motion

Canonical sources:

- `motion/amd/src/easyedu_motion.js`
- `motion/README.md`
- `docs/components/animations.md`

Must:

- vendor and namespace the canonical controller instead of creating a second
  plugin-specific motion engine;
- expose `data-easyedu-motion-policy` in server-rendered markup;
- let `prefers-reduced-motion` override the administrator policy;
- use distance-aware disclosures for short search and paste panels;
- use one atomic `swap` for full-view changes;
- use fade-only swaps with zero translation and no height interpolation for
  pagination inside scrollable columns;
- await disclosure completion before focusing a field;
- cancel completed Web Animation fill effects after cleanup;
- batch DOM reads before writes and recalculate pagination only once per action;
- test repeated open/close/open cycles and widths during pagination.

Must not:

- combine controller-owned height motion with CSS `max-height` transitions;
- animate a disclosure and each auto-sized ancestor simultaneously;
- translate a scrollable pagination list;
- rebuild every sorted/paginated list for a checkbox-only state change;
- use timeout chains to repair stale heights after an animation.

## Guide: checklist persistence

Must:

- support `requiresStep` dependencies between checklist steps;
- support `requiresStepLabel`;
- show a disabled/locked visual state for blocked checklist steps with
  `data-easyedu-guide-lock-message`;
- use the same subtle striped locked visual language for blocked checklist
  steps and locked navigation cards;
- show the required step title inside the blocked-step overlay so the user sees
  exactly which checklist step unlocks the current one;
- support `completeOnClick` for actions that reload the page;
- require every checklist step to declare its completion ownership with
  `completionMode` when it represents a real action;
- keep `action`, `event` and `reload` steps pending when their checklist row
  is clicked;
- support `waitForCompletion` only as a compatibility alias while migrating
  older plugin configurations;
- complete event-owned steps through `easyedu:guide-step-complete` after the
  underlying operation succeeds;
- match `completeOnClick` targets from the clicked element with
  `closest(selector)` so repeated controls such as dropdown options all work;
- persist active path, active step, completed steps and active slide;
- restore the checklist after reload;
- clear checklist progress, highlights and return panels when the checklist is
  closed or when the main guide is opened normally;
- when minimized, display the pending active step and visited counter.

Must not:

- mark `completeOnClick` steps complete when the user only clicks the checklist;
- mark action, event or reload steps complete from the checklist click;
- resolve only the first matching `completeOnClick` target with `querySelector`;
- lose the guide context after a real page reload;
- show only a generic title in the minimized checklist.
- close or hide the checklist when a guided highlight auto-hides.

## Compact action menus

Canonical files:

- `scss/easyedu/components/_menus.scss`
- `docs/components/dropdowns.md`

Must:

- use the kit compact action trigger for overflow/action menus;
- use readable menu items with accessible focus states;
- avoid custom hover bubbles inside menus when the visible item label is enough;
- keep menus above neighbouring cards and panels.

Must not:

- use bare `...` buttons for action menus;
- create plugin-specific menu item spacing when a kit primitive exists;
- add native `title` to menu items that already have visible labels.

## Buttons and controls

Canonical files:

- `scss/easyedu/components/_buttons.scss`
- `docs/components/buttons.md`

Must:

- use button size and state primitives from the kit;
- keep icon alignment stable;
- support hover, active, focus-visible and disabled states;
- use Moodle-compatible button markup.

Must not:

- hard-code button heights or radii locally for reusable controls;
- use inconsistent icon-only hit areas;
- rely on text-only affordances where the kit defines an icon control.

## Cards and identity rails

Canonical files:

- `scss/easyedu/components/_cards.scss`
- `docs/components/cards.md`

Must:

- use `object-card`, `identity-rail` and `selectable-card` for manipulable
  objects;
- use `open-identity-rail-base` / `open-identity-rail-state` for opened
  container cards;
- use `preview-fade-list` with `card-reveal-toggle` for collapsed child lists
  such as members, groups inside a grouping, layers inside a folder, or similar
  nested content;
- use related-tag summary/detail primitives when related labels become too long
  for a single row;
- expose real selection controls in addition to visual selected states.

Must not:

- create a second left rail to fake an opened container state;
- show drag handles on objects that are not draggable in the current view;
- let related tags push badges or action buttons onto a new line.
- implement one-off gradients for collapsed child previews.

## Forms, filters and admin controls

Canonical files:

- `scss/easyedu/components/_forms.scss`
- `docs/components/forms.md`

Must:

- use compact form sizes in dense runtime filters and regular/large sizes in
  admin settings;
- use `selection-checkbox` for selectable cards, nested items and list rows;
- use `inline-reveal-panel` for card-contained search, paste, add-by-text or
  similar controls that expand inside a card;
- use `toggle-check` for binary filters inside EasyEdu filter boxes;
- use `multi-select-list(small)` for runtime filters and
  `multi-select-list(regular|large)` for settings/admin screens;
- keep focus rings on the full control wrapper.

Must not:

- use admin-sized multiselects inside card/list filter panels;
- make allowed checkboxes look disabled because another nested card type owns
  the parent container;
- replace native selects with custom lists unless keyboard and screen-reader
  behaviour is rebuilt deliberately;
- put long help text in labels when a help icon/tooltip is more appropriate.

## Badges, tokens and counters

Canonical files:

- `scss/easyedu/components/_feedback.scss`
- `docs/components/badges.md`

Must:

- use `identity-badge` for one high-priority title-line metadata badge;
- use count badge variants for numeric counts;
- use token overflow toggles for collapsed metadata lists.

Must not:

- use identity badges for numeric counters;
- let title-line metadata push primary actions out of the card header;
- rely on raw text for `+N` or collapse controls when a token style exists.

## Modals and metadata surfaces

Canonical files:

- `scss/easyedu/components/_modals.scss`
- `docs/components/modals.md`

Must:

- use `modal-runtime-animation` for custom and Moodle native modals;
- use `native-modal-loading` when a Moodle native modal resolves content
  asynchronously;
- use `settings-modal-dialog`, `metadata-section`, `metadata-scroll-list`,
  `metadata-item-chip` and `metadata-empty` for rich object detail/settings
  modals;
- use `settings-modal-filepicker` and `modal-file-drop-state` for image/file
  uploads.

Must not:

- leave raw `x` close controls;
- let a modal exceed the viewport because related lists are not collapsed into
  metadata sections;
- restyle file pickers independently in each plugin.

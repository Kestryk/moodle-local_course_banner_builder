# Cards

Cards represent user-manipulable objects: participants, groups, groupings,
layers, images, sources or any plugin-specific item.

## Mixins

```scss
.my-card {
  @include easyedu.object-card(var(--easyedu-group));
  @include easyedu.identity-rail(var(--easyedu-icon-group));
  @include easyedu.selectable-card(var(--easyedu-group));
  @include easyedu.drag-handle;
}

.my-card__reveal {
  @include easyedu.card-reveal-toggle;
}

.my-card__preview-list {
  @include easyedu.preview-fade-list(
    4.2rem,
    36rem,
    var(--easyedu-surface-soft)
  );
}

.my-card__related-tags {
  @include easyedu.related-tags-inline;
}

.my-card__related-tags-summary {
  @include easyedu.related-tags-summary;
}

.my-card__related-tags-summary .fa {
  @include easyedu.related-tags-summary-icon;
}

.my-card.is-tags-expanded .my-card__related-tags-summary .fa {
  @include easyedu.related-tags-expanded-icon;
}

.my-card__related-tags-details {
  @include easyedu.related-tags-details;
}

.my-card__related-tags-details-list {
  @include easyedu.related-tags-details-list;
}

.my-container-card {
  @include easyedu.open-identity-rail-base(#f7fafc, #b7c5d1);

  &.is-expanded {
    @include easyedu.open-identity-rail-state(#f7fafc, #a9bac7, #a3b3c0);
  }
}
```

## Variants

- `object-card`: base card shell with identity border.
- `identity-rail`: icon embedded in the left identity rail.
- `selectable-card`: selected/aria-selected states.
- `expanded-card`: smooth expanded state foundation.
- `drag-handle`: swaps the identity icon for a drag handle on hover.
- `disabled-card`: compatible visual disabled state for non-target columns.
- `open-identity-rail-base` / `open-identity-rail-state`: turns the filled
  identity rail into a light outlined rail for opened container cards.
- `card-reveal-toggle`: quiet full-width chevron for revealing hidden card
  content such as members, related groups or advanced metadata.
- `preview-fade-list`: collapsed preview list with a smoke/fade ending and a
  smooth expanded state. Use it for members inside a group, groups inside a
  grouping, or any dense child list where the first items should remain visible.
- `related-tags-inline`: keeps related-object pills on one title line without
  pushing action buttons or count badges out of alignment.
- `related-tags-summary`: count/summary pill used when related tags are too long
  or too numerous to display inline.
- `related-tags-details` / `related-tags-details-list`: revealed row for the
  complete related-object list.
- `density-transition`: shared transition timing for cards that switch between
  compact and detailed density.

## Expected structure

```html
<article class="my-card" aria-selected="false">
  <header class="my-card__header">
    <span class="my-card__title">Object name</span>
    <span class="my-card__related-tags">
      <button class="my-card__related-tags-summary" type="button">
        <span>2 groupings</span>
        <span class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      </button>
    </span>
  </header>
  <ul class="my-card__preview-list has-extra-items" aria-expanded="false">
    <li>Visible child item</li>
    <li>Partially faded child item</li>
    <li>Hidden child item</li>
  </ul>
  <button class="my-card__reveal" type="button" aria-expanded="false">
    <span class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Show more items</span>
  </button>
  <div class="my-card__related-tags-details" hidden>
    <div class="my-card__related-tags-details-list">
      <span class="my-token">Grouping A</span>
      <span class="my-token">Grouping B</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</article>
```

## Accessibility

Cards that are selectable should expose a real checkbox or button in addition to
visual selected state. Do not rely on drag/drop as the only interaction method.

Related-tag summaries must be real buttons with `aria-expanded` when they reveal
the complete tag list.

Preview lists must pair their visible transition state with a real reveal
button. Keep `aria-expanded` synchronized on the button and, when useful, on the
preview list itself.

## Import Audit Checklist

- Object cards use an identity rail token for their object type: participant,
  group, grouping, layer, source or another plugin-owned identity.
- The identity icon sits inside the rail; drag handles may replace it on hover
  only when the object is actually draggable.
- Selected/focus states darken the identity colour consistently and do not
  depend only on checkbox colour.
- Open container cards use `open-identity-rail-base` and
  `open-identity-rail-state`; do not duplicate a second rail inside the card.
- Long related-object labels collapse into a summary pill before they push
  count badges or action buttons onto a new line.
- Related-tag summary buttons expose `aria-expanded` and reveal the full tag row
  in `related-tags-details`.
- Child previews with a fade use `preview-fade-list` plus
  `card-reveal-toggle`; avoid implementing a one-off white gradient that breaks
  on themed cards.
- Dense/compact-to-full card transitions use `density-transition`; plugins own
  which data becomes visible in each density.
- Drag/drop disabled states use `disabled-card` or overlay primitives; do not
  make selectable checkboxes look disabled when the current selection type is
  still allowed.

Plugin-owned details:

- Exact domain layout inside the card body.
- Business rules for drag/drop compatibility.
- Pagination/filtering that decides which cards are visible.
- Context menu commands and permission checks.

# EasyEdu UI Kit Architecture

The EasyEdu UI Kit is an embedded design system for independent Moodle plugins.
It is copied into each plugin at build/development time; Moodle administrators do
not need to install a shared dependency.

## Goals

- Keep EasyEdu plugins visually consistent.
- Keep every plugin installable on its own.
- Keep Moodle themes able to override the visual layer through public CSS
  custom properties.
- Keep SCSS readable for humans who need to maintain, theme or audit it.
- Provide reusable guide/onboarding patterns, not only static component styles.

## Package layers

```text
easyedu-ui-kit/
  scss/easyedu/  Public SCSS tokens and mixins.
  guide/         Generic guide AMD/template/language foundation.
  docs/          Component API and integration notes.
  examples/      Optional plugin-specific examples.
```

## SCSS API model

The kit avoids emitting global CSS by default. Plugins import the kit and include
mixins under their own root selectors:

```scss
@use "easyedu" as easyedu;

.local-coursebannerbuilder {
  @include easyedu.token-defaults;
  @include easyedu.guide-shell;
}
```

This keeps selectors plugin-owned and makes theme overrides predictable.

## Naming conventions

- Public custom properties use `--easyedu-*`.
- Plugin compatibility aliases may exist, but should stay in plugin-specific
  compatibility mixins.
- Reusable classes in templates use `.easyedu-*`.
- Plugin classes should remain plugin-prefixed, e.g. `.local-coursebannerbuilder`.

## Theming contract

Themes should override variables on a plugin root:

```scss
.local-coursebannerbuilder {
  --easyedu-primary: #005f73;
  --easyedu-accent: #2a9d8f;
  --easyedu-card-radius: 1rem;
}
```

Avoid overriding internal selectors unless a theme intentionally wants a deeper
visual customisation.

## Extraction policy

When extracting from EasyStud/groupimport:

1. Identify the reusable behaviour and visual intent.
2. Convert hard-coded values to tokens where useful.
3. Create a mixin with a Moodle/plugin-neutral name.
4. Keep plugin-specific selectors out of the kit.
5. Document expected HTML, tokens and variants.
6. Add a compile check before tagging.

## Versioning

- Patch versions: compatible visual/component additions.
- Minor versions: new component families or guide behaviours.
- Major versions: breaking selector, token or mixin changes.
